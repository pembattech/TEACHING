# Advanced MySQL commands:

**1. Filtering data with WHERE clause:**

```sql
SELECT * FROM orders WHERE order_date > '2024-01-01' AND status = 'shipped';
```

This query retrieves all orders placed after January 1st, 2024, and that are currently shipped.

**2. Sorting data with ORDER BY clause:**

```sql
SELECT * FROM customers ORDER BY last_name ASC, first_name DESC;
```

This query retrieves all customers sorted by last name in ascending order and then by first name in descending order.

**3. Grouping data with GROUP BY clause:**

```sql
SELECT product_name, COUNT(*) AS total_sales FROM sales_record GROUP BY product_name;
```

This query groups sales data by product name and displays the product name and total number of sales for each product.

**4. Joining tables with JOIN clause:**

```sql
SELECT orders.order_id, customers.name, products.product_name
FROM orders
INNER JOIN customers ON orders.customer_id = customers.id
INNER JOIN products ON orders.product_id = products.id;
```

This query joins three tables: orders, customers, and products, to retrieve order details, customer names, and product names for each order.

**5. Subqueries for complex filtering:**

```sql
SELECT * FROM orders
WHERE customer_id IN (
  SELECT id FROM customers WHERE city = 'New York'
);
```

This query retrieves orders placed by customers located in New York City. It uses a subquery to first find all customer IDs for customers in New York and then uses those IDs to filter the orders table.
