### üêç **The `os` Module**


#### üì¶ **1. What is the `os` module?**

The `os` module in Python provides a way to interact with the operating system‚Äôs functionalities‚Äîsuch as working with files and directories‚Äîusing Python code.
It is great for scripting tasks, automation, and system-level work.


```python
import os
```


### üìÅ **2. Commonly Used `os` Functions**

#### ‚úÖ **Get current working directory**

```python
import os

print(os.getcwd())  # Shows the current working directory
```


#### üìÇ **List files in a directory**

```python
print(os.listdir())  # Lists files and folders in the current directory
```

Or specify a path:

```python
print(os.listdir("/path/to/directory"))
```


#### üìÅ **Create a new directory**

```python
os.mkdir("new_folder")  # Creates a single folder
```

Or recursively:

```python
os.makedirs("folder/subfolder")  # Creates nested directories
```


#### ‚ùå **Remove a directory**

```python
os.rmdir("new_folder")  # Removes an empty folder
```


#### üîÑ **Change current working directory**

```python
os.chdir("path/to/folder")
```


#### üìÉ **Rename a file**

```python
os.rename("old.txt", "new.txt")
```


### üåç **3. Environment Variables**

```python
print(os.environ)  # Get all environment variables
print(os.environ.get("PATH"))  # Get a specific one
```

---

### üìå **4. Path Utilities (with `os.path`)**

```python
import os

print(os.path.exists("file.txt"))  # Check if a file exists
print(os.path.isfile("file.txt"))  # Check if it's a file
print(os.path.isdir("folder"))     # Check if it's a folder
```

### üßëüíª **5. Get the Current Username**

```python
import os

username = os.getlogin()  # Gets the name of the logged-in user
print("Current user:", username)
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: `os.getlogin()` may raise an error in some environments like IDEs or remote sessions. Use `getpass` as a fallback:

```python
import getpass

username = getpass.getuser()
print("Current user:", username)
```

---

### üñ•Ô∏è **6. Get Operating System Info**

#### Basic platform info using `os.name`:

```python
print("OS name:", os.name)  # 'posix', 'nt', or 'java'
```

#### Detailed system info using `platform` module:

```python
import platform

print("System:", platform.system())      # e.g., Windows, Linux, Darwin
print("Release:", platform.release())    # OS version
print("Version:", platform.version())    # Detailed version info
```

---

### üåç **7. Get Environment Variables**

```python
print(os.environ)  # Dictionary of all env variables
print(os.environ.get("HOME"))  # Get a specific one
```

---

### üîß **8. Path Utilities**

```python
print(os.path.exists("file.txt"))  # Check if file exists
print(os.path.isfile("file.txt"))  # Check if it's a file
print(os.path.isdir("folder"))     # Check if it's a directory
```

pip install selenium
```

You‚Äôll also need a **WebDriver** for your browser:

* Chrome ‚Üí [Download ChromeDriver](https://sites.google.com/chromium.org/driver/)
* Firefox ‚Üí [Download GeckoDriver](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases)

Put the WebDriver in your PATH or specify its path in your script.

---

### üöÄ **3. First Script: Open a Website**

```python
from selenium import webdriver

driver = webdriver.Chrome()  # Launches Chrome
driver.get("https://www.google.com")  # Opens Google
```

Make sure `chromedriver` is accessible or provide the full path:

```python
driver = webdriver.Chrome(executable_path="C:/path/to/chromedriver.exe")
```

---

### ‚úèÔ∏è **4. Interacting with Web Elements**

#### Search on Google:

```python
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
from selenium.webdriver.common.keys import Keys

driver = webdriver.Chrome()
driver.get("https://www.google.com")

search_box = driver.find_element(By.NAME, "q")  # Locate search box
search_box.send_keys("Selenium Python")         # Type search text
search_box.send_keys(Keys.RETURN)               # Press Enter
```

---

### üîç **5. Locating Elements**

| Method            | Example                                         |

| `By.NAME`         | `find_element(By.NAME, "q")`                    |
| `By.CLASS_NAME`   | `find_element(By.CLASS_NAME, "btn")`            |
| `By.TAG_NAME`     | `find_element(By.TAG_NAME, "input")`            |
| `By.CSS_SELECTOR` | `find_element(By.CSS_SELECTOR, "div.box")`      |
| `By.XPATH`        | `find_element(By.XPATH, "//input[@id='name']")` |

---

### ‚úÖ **6. Best Practices**

* Always close the browser when done:

```python
driver.quit()
```

* Use `WebDriverWait` for dynamic pages:

```python
from selenium.webdriver.support.ui import WebDriverWait
from selenium.webdriver.support import expected_conditions as EC

wait = WebDriverWait(driver, 10)
element = wait.until(EC.presence_of_element_located((By.ID, "some_id")))
```

Awesome choice! Let's walk through **speech recognition in Python**‚Äîan exciting topic for voice-controlled apps, accessibility tools, and audio transcription.

---

## üé§ **Python Lesson: Speech Recognition**

---

### üéØ **Learning Objectives**

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:

* Understand how speech recognition works in Python.
* Use the `speech_recognition` library to convert spoken words into text.
* Handle real-time microphone input or audio file transcription.

---

### üì¶ **1. Installing Required Package**

Install the `speechrecognition` package (and `pyaudio` for mic input):

```bash
pip install SpeechRecognition
pip install pyaudio
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** On some systems, installing `pyaudio` might require additional setup (like `portaudio` on macOS/Linux). If it's hard to install, you can use audio files instead of a microphone.

---

### üìò **2. Basic Setup**

```python
import speech_recognition as sr

recognizer = sr.Recognizer()
```

---

### üéôÔ∏è **3. Speech to Text Using Microphone**

```python
import speech_recognition as sr

recognizer = sr.Recognizer()

with sr.Microphone() as source:
    print("Say something...")
    audio = recognizer.listen(source)

try:
    text = recognizer.recognize_google(audio)
    print("You said:", text)
except sr.UnknownValueError:
    print("Could not understand audio")
except sr.RequestError:
    print("Request to Google Speech API failed")
```

> ‚úÖ Uses **Google Web Speech API** (free, online).

---

### üîä **4. Speech to Text from an Audio File**

Supported formats: `.wav`, `.aiff`, `.flac` (not MP3 directly).

```python
with sr.AudioFile("example.wav") as source:
    audio = recognizer.record(source)

text = recognizer.recognize_google(audio)
print("Transcription:", text)
```

---

### üß† **5. Other Recognizers (Offline/Cloud)**

* `recognize_google()` ‚Äì free & online.
* `recognize_sphinx()` ‚Äì offline but needs `pocketsphinx`.
* `recognize_ibm()`, `recognize_bing()`, etc. ‚Äì cloud services with API keys.

---

### üß™ **6. Mini Project: Voice Command App**

```python
import speech_recognition as sr

def listen_and_respond():
    recognizer = sr.Recognizer()
    with sr.Microphone() as source:
        print("Listening...")
        audio = recognizer.listen(source)

    try:
        command = recognizer.recognize_google(audio)
        print(f"You said: {command}")
        if "hello" in command.lower():
            print("Hi there!")
        elif "weather" in command.lower():
            print("I can't check the weather yet, but I'm learning.")
    except Exception as e:
        print("Error:", e)

listen_and_respond()
```

pip install --upgrade flask
```

#### üìã **List Installed Packages**

```bash
pip list
```

#### üîç **Check Info About a Package**

```bash
pip show package_name
```

---

### üìÇ **3. Install from a Requirements File**

This is commonly used in projects to install all dependencies at once.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

`requirements.txt` looks like:

```
flask==2.2.0
requests>=2.28.0
```

---

### üîß **4. Where pip Installs Packages**

By default, pip installs packages into the **site-packages** directory inside your Python environment.

You can check the install location with:

```bash
pip show package_name
```

---

### üß™ **5. Virtual Environments + pip (Best Practice)**

For projects, it's best to use a **virtual environment** so that packages don‚Äôt interfere across projects:

```bash
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # On Mac/Linux
env\Scripts\activate     # On Windows
pip install flask
```

---

### üßØ **6. Troubleshooting pip**

| Problem                  | Solution                                             |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `pip: command not found` | Use `python -m pip install ...`                      |
| Permission denied        | Use `--user` or install inside a virtual environment |
| Proxy issues             | Use `--proxy` option                                 |
| SSL errors               | Upgrade pip: `python -m pip install --upgrade pip`   |

---

### üìö **7. Summary**

* `pip` is used to manage Python packages.
* You can install, remove, and upgrade libraries.
* Always use virtual environments when working on projects.
* `requirements.txt` helps share dependencies easily.
