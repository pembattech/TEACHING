## XAMPP

XAMPP is a bundle of web-server products, rather than a server itself. it provides you:

- <b>Apache</b> ( runs kphp, responds to HTTP request.)
- <b>MySQL</b> (the database, it stores data)
- <b>FTP</b> ( tool to upload and download files from your server, in case you don't have direct access to it.)
