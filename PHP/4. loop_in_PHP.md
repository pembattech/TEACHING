## Loop Examples in PHP:


**1. for loop (printing numbers 1 to 5):**

```php
for ($i = 1; $i <= 5; $i++) {
  echo $i . " ";
}
```

**Output:**

```
1 2 3 4 5 
```



**2. while loop (repeating a message):**

```php
$count = 0;

while ($count < 3) {
  echo "Hello World!" . PHP_EOL;
  $count++;
}
```

**Output:**

```
Hello World!
Hello World!
Hello World!
```

##### Note:
``` PHP_EOL ``` is a predefined constant in PHP that represents the end-of-line character. It's particularly useful when you need your code to be compatible with different operating systems because each system uses a different character sequence to mark the end of a line


**3. foreach loop (iterating over a simple array):**

```php
$colors = ["red", "green", "blue"];

foreach ($colors as $color) {
  echo $color . " ";
}
```

**Output:**

```
red green blue 
```

## do...while loop examples:

**1. Guessing game:**

```php
$secretNumber = 7;
$guess = 0;

do {
  echo "Guess a number between 1 and 10: ";
  $guess = intval(fgets(STDIN)); // Read user input and convert to integer

  if ($guess == $secretNumber) {
    echo "Congratulations! You guessed the number." . PHP_EOL;
  } else {
    echo "Try again!" . PHP_EOL;
  }
} while ($guess != $secretNumber);
```

**2. Password validation:**

```php
$password = "";

do {
  echo "Enter a password (minimum 8 characters): ";
  $password = rtrim(fgets(STDIN)); // Read user input and remove trailing newline

} while (strlen($password) < 8);

echo "Your password is set." . PHP_EOL;
```
