## Examples of working with dates in PHP:

**1. Getting the Current Date and Time:**

```php
$today = date("Y-m-d H:i:s");  // Outputs something like "2024-06-28 18:04:07"

echo "Today's date and time: $today";
```

**Output:**

```
Today's date and time: 2024-06-28 (This will update to the current time when you run the script)
```

**2. Converting Between Formats:**

```php
$dateString = "July 14, 2025";
$timestamp = strtotime($dateString);  // Convert to timestamp

$formattedDate = date("d/m/Y", $timestamp);  // Convert timestamp back to format with "/" separators

echo "Converted date: $formattedDate";  // Outputs: 14/07/2025
```

**Output:**

```
Converted date: 14/07/2025
```

**3. Calculating Age based on Birthdate:**

```php
function calculateAge($birthdateString) {
  $birthdate = strtotime($birthdateString);  // Convert birthdate string to timestamp
  $now = time();  // Get current timestamp
  $age = date('Y', $now) - date('Y', $birthdate); 

  // Check for months and days if birthdate is in the current year
  if (date('md', $now) < date('md', $birthdate)) {
    $age--;
  }

  return $age;
}

$birthdate = "1980-01-31";
$age = calculateAge($birthdate);

echo "Age: $age";
```

**Output:** (assuming today's date is June 28, 2024)

```
Age: 44
```

**4. Finding Days Until a Specific Event:**

```php
$eventDate = "2024-12-25";  // Christmas 2024
$eventTimestamp = strtotime($eventDate);
$today = time();

$daysUntilEvent = (int)(($eventTimestamp - $today) / (60 * 60 * 24));

echo "Days until Christmas: $daysUntilEvent";
```

**Output:** (assuming today's date is June 28, 2024)

```
Days until Christmas: 180
```

**5. Displaying Events Happening Soon:**

```php
$today = time();

// Today's events
$todayEvents = strtotime('today');

// Events happening tomorrow
$tomorrowEvents = strtotime('tomorrow');

// Events happening next week
$nextWeekEvents = strtotime('next week');

echo "Events happening today: " . date("Y-m-d", $todayEvents) . PHP_EOL;
echo "Events happening tomorrow: " . date("Y-m-d", $tomorrowEvents) . PHP_EOL;
echo "Events happening next week (starting): " . date("Y-m-d", $nextWeekEvents) . PHP_EOL;
```

**Output:** (assuming today's date is June 28, 2024)

```
Events happening today: 2024-06-28
Events happening tomorrow: 2024-06-29
Events happening next week (starting): 2024-07-01
```

**6. Checking for Past or Upcoming Birthdays:**

```php
function isBirthdaySoon($birthdateString) {
  $birthdate = strtotime($birthdateString);
  $today = time();
  $birthYear = date('Y', $birthdate);
  $currentYear = date('Y', $today);

  // Check if birthday has already passed this year
  $birthdayThisYear = strtotime($birthYear . '-' . date('m-d', $birthdate));
  if ($birthdayThisYear < $today) {
    $nextBirthday = strtotime('+1 year', $birthdayThisYear);
  } else {
    $nextBirthday = $birthdayThisYear;
  }

  $daysUntilBirthday = (int)(($nextBirthday - $today) / (60 * 60 * 24));

  return $daysUntilBirthday <= 7; // Change this to desired timeframe (e.g., <= 30 for birthdays within a month)
}

$birthdate = "1990-05-12";


if (isBirthdaySoon($birthdate)) {
  echo "Happy almost birthday!";
} else {
  echo "Birthday is not soon.";
}
```

**Output:** (assuming today's date is June 28, 2024)

```
Birthday is not soon.
```
