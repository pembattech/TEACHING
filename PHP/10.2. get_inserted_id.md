There are two main approaches to retrieve the ID of the data you just inserted in PHP with MySQL:

**1. Using `mysqli_insert_id`:**

This method is the most common and efficient way to get the ID of the last inserted row. It works if you have an auto-incrementing primary key defined for the ID column in your table.

```php
<?php

// Connect to the database (assumed $conn is established elsewhere)

$name = "Jane Doe";
$email = "jane.doe@example.com";
$phone = "456-789-0123";

$sql = "INSERT INTO users (name, email, phone) VALUES ('$name', '$email', '$phone')";

if ($conn->query($sql) === TRUE) {
  $last_id = mysqli_insert_id($conn);
  echo "New record created successfully. Last inserted ID: " . $last_id;
} else {
  echo "Error: " . $sql . "<br>" . $conn->error;
}

$conn->close();
?>
```

**2. Retrieving the Inserted Data and Extracting the ID:**

This approach involves performing another query to fetch the data you just inserted and extracting the ID from that data. It's less efficient than `mysqli_insert_id` but can be useful in some scenarios (e.g., when you need additional information about the inserted row besides the ID).

```php
<?php

// Connect to the database (assumed $conn is established elsewhere)

$name = "Jane Doe";
$email = "jane.doe@example.com";
$phone = "456-789-0123";

$sql = "INSERT INTO users (name, email, phone) VALUES ('$name', '$email', '$phone')";

if ($conn->query($sql) === TRUE) {
  // Get the maximum ID from the table (assuming ID is auto-incrementing)
  $sql_id = "SELECT MAX(id) AS last_id FROM users";
  $result_id = $conn->query($sql_id);

  if ($result_id->num_rows > 0) {
    $row_id = $result_id->fetch_assoc();
    $last_id = $row_id["last_id"];
    echo "New record created successfully. Last inserted ID: " . $last_id;
  } else {
    echo "Error retrieving inserted ID";
  }
} else {
  echo "Error: " . $sql . "<br>" . $conn->error;
}

$conn->close();
?>
```
