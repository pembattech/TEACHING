## Building Relationships: Foreign Keys and Multiple Tables

Foreign keys are a fundamental concept in relational databases, allowing you to establish connections between different tables. This fosters data integrity, consistency, and enables efficient querying across multiple tables.

**What are Foreign Keys?**

Imagine a library scenario where you have two tables: one for `Books` and another for `Borrowers`. While both tables hold important information, they lack a direct link. Here's where foreign keys come into play.

A foreign key in one table references the primary key of another table. In our library example, the `Borrowers` table could have a `book_id` column that acts as a foreign key. This `book_id` would reference the primary key (often named `id` or similar) in the `Books` table.

**Benefits of Foreign Keys:**

- **Data Integrity:** Foreign keys ensure data consistency by preventing invalid references. In the library example, a borrower record can't reference a non-existent book because the `book_id` must correspond to a valid entry in the `Books` table.
- **Efficient Queries:** Foreign keys enable powerful JOIN operations in SQL queries. These JOINs allow you to retrieve data from multiple tables based on their relationships established through foreign keys.

**Example: E-commerce Website with PHP**

Let's consider a practical example of an e-commerce website with Products and Orders tables:

- **Customers Table:**

  - customer_id (primary key)
  - customer_name

- **Products Table:**
  - product_id (primary key)
  - product_name
  - price
- **Orders Table:**
  - order_id (primary key)
  - customer_id (foreign key referencing Customers table)
  - product_id (foreign key referencing Products table)
  - quantity

**Fetching Product Information for an Order**

**1. Creating Tables:**

```sql
CREATE TABLE customers (
  customer_id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  customer_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE products (
  product_id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  product_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  price DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE orders (
  order_id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  customer_id INT NOT NULL,
  product_id INT NOT NULL,
  quantity INT NOT NULL,
  FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES customers (customer_id),
  FOREIGN KEY (product_id) REFERENCES products (product_id)
);
```

**2. Inserting Data (Sample Data):**

```sql
INSERT INTO customers (customer_name) VALUES ('John Doe');
INSERT INTO customers (customer_name) VALUES ('Jane Smith');

INSERT INTO products (product_name, price) VALUES ('T-Shirt', 19.99);
INSERT INTO products (product_name, price) VALUES ('Laptop', 799.99);

INSERT INTO orders (customer_id, product_id, quantity) VALUES (1, 1, 2);  -- John Doe orders 2 T-Shirts
INSERT INTO orders (customer_id, product_id, quantity) VALUES (2, 2, 1);  -- Jane Smith orders 1 Laptop
```

**3. Fetching Customer Order Details and Calculating Total Cost (Separate Queries and PHP Logic):**

```php
<?php

// Connect to the database
$conn = mysqli_connect("localhost", "username", "password", "database_name");

// Check connection
if (!$conn) {
  die("Connection failed: " . mysqli_connect_error());
}

// Customer ID to fetch orders for
$customer_id = 2;

// 1. Get Customer Name
$sql_customer = "SELECT customer_name FROM customers WHERE customer_id = $customer_id";
$result_customer = mysqli_query($conn, $sql_customer);

if ($result_customer && mysqli_num_rows($result_customer) > 0) {
  $row_customer = mysqli_fetch_assoc($result_customer);
  $customer_name = $row_customer['customer_name'];

  echo "<h3>Customer Name: " . $customer_name . "</h3>";

  // 2. Get Orders for the Customer
  $sql_orders = "SELECT * FROM orders WHERE customer_id = $customer_id";
  $result_orders = mysqli_query($conn, $sql_orders);

  if ($result_orders && mysqli_num_rows($result_orders) > 0) {
    while ($row_order = mysqli_fetch_assoc($result_orders)) {
      $order_id = $row_order['order_id'];
      $product_id = $row_order['product_id'];
      $quantity = $row_order['quantity'];

      // 3. Get Product Details
      $sql_product = "SELECT product_name, price FROM products WHERE product_id = $product_id";
      $result_product = mysqli_query($conn, $sql_product);

      if ($result_product && mysqli_num_rows($result_product) > 0) {
        $row_product = mysqli_fetch_assoc($result_product);
        $product_name = $row_product['product_name'];
        $price = $row_product['price'];
        $total = $price * $quantity;

        echo "<strong>Order ID:</strong> " . $order_id . "<br>";
        echo "Product: " . $product_name . "<br>";
        echo "Price: $" . number_format($price, 2) . "<br>";
        echo "Quantity: " . $quantity . "<br>";
        echo "<strong>Total: $" . number_format($total, 2) . "</strong><br>";
        echo "<hr>";
      } else {
        echo "Product not found for Product ID: $product_id<br><hr>";
      }
    }
  } else {
    echo "No orders found for customer ID: $customer_id";
  }
} else {
  echo "Customer not found with ID: $customer_id";
}

// Close connection
mysqli_close($conn);
?>

```


**Output Example:**
```
Customer Name: Jane Smith

Order ID: 2
Product: Laptop
Price: $799.99
Quantity: 1
Total: $799.99
```
