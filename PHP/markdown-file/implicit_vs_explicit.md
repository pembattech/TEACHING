In programming, the terms "implicit" and "explicit" refer to how something is done or specified in the code. Here's a breakdown of their meaning:

**Implicit:**

- **Automatic:** The program or system handles something behind the scenes without requiring the programmer to explicitly code it.
- **Inferred:** The program can determine what needs to happen based on the context or surrounding code.
- **Can be less clear:** Implicit behavior might not be immediately obvious from reading the code, potentially making it harder to understand or maintain.

**Example:**

In PHP, when you declare a variable without specifying its type, PHP automatically assigns a type based on the value assigned to it. This is implicit type declaration.

```php
$x = 10; // Implicitly becomes an integer
$y = "Hello"; // Implicitly becomes a string
```

**Explicit:**

- **Manual:** The programmer explicitly instructs the program what to do or how to handle something.
- **Clear and intentional:** The code clearly states what the programmer wants to achieve.
- **More control:** Explicit instructions provide more control over the program's behavior.

**Example:**

In PHP, you can explicitly declare a variable's type using the type declaration syntax.

```php
$age: int = 25; // Explicitly declaring $age as an integer
$name: string = "Alice"; // Explicitly declaring $name as a string
```

**Choosing Between Implicit and Explicit:**

- **Clarity:** If explicit coding makes the code easier to understand and maintain, it's generally preferred.
- **Control:** For situations where you need precise control over data types or program behavior, explicit coding is essential.
- **Performance:** In some cases, implicit conversions might have a slight performance advantage (though usually negligible). However, prioritize readability and maintainability over minor performance gains unless absolutely necessary.

**When to Use Implicit vs. Explicit:**

- **Implicit:** Use implicit behavior when it's clear, concise, and doesn't introduce ambiguity. 
- **Explicit:** Use explicit instructions when clarity, control, or avoiding unexpected behavior is crucial.

Ultimately, the choice depends on the specific context and coding style. However, striking a balance between clarity and conciseness is often the goal.
